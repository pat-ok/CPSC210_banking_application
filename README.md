# Banking Application

## What does the application do?
This application allows you to register a bank account with a unique username and a secure password.
It allows you to login and perform different transactions such as:
- Check balance, deposit money, and withdraw money
- eTransfer money to other registered users
- Receive inbox notifications for incoming eTransfers



## Who will use it?
Any company looking to do monetary transfers across unique accounts would use this application.
Customers of the company would sign up for accounts.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I am interested in the process of implementing user specific data storage with account authentication.
This application stores account data in hashmap values, with the keys being unique usernames.
Passwords are hashed and salted for security from database breaches.
